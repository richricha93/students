I am Jonathan Ting and I am a 2nd-year coursework-only master's computer engineering student. I am working in the TENNLab research group researching how FPGA and custom hardware design can be used to support neuromorphic computing. After graduating, I will be working full-time as an ASIC verification engineer. As a hobby, I enjoy using backend and frontend frameworks such as Django and Svelte to bring random ideas of mine to life. In terms of projects, I'm interested in furthering my knowledge of databases and how backends can serve more complex platforms beyond web apps. I'd also be interested in projects that help improve software development workflows. I consider myself proficient in Python, C, and C++, and also have experience in C#.
