Hi, I'm Austin. My areas of interest in software are emulators, compilers, systems programming, and optimization. I'm also a big fan of the Rust programming language lately, if you're thinking of doing a Rust project! My main goal in taking this class are to get an opportunity to work on a project that may push me a little out of my comfort zone and introduce me to new tech and concepts.
