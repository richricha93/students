Hi, I am Christopher Lee. I am a Master's student in Computer Science. I am a part of the 5-Year MS/BS program and graduate this semester. I am excited to take this class as I have taken a class with Dr. Mockus before and thoroughly enjoyed it. I plan to go into Software Engineering/development and hope to get necessary skills from this class that will help me in the real world.
