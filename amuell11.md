My name is Andrew Mueller, and I am a Masters student on a course only track. 

I have a few interests, the biggest one is more just general software development. I would like to do something
this semester that is related to data analaysis, and I already have some sort of project in mind, so I might pursue that
project with a few people who also have that project in mind.
