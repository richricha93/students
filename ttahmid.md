I am Tokey Tahmid. I am a Computer Science Master's student. I work as a GRA at Innovative Computing Lab (ICL). I am working on scalability of Spiking Neural Networks using High-Performance Computing. For the course project, I would like to do something using AI specially using Large Language Models (LLMs).
