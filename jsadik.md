I am John Sadik, and I am a PhD student in Computer Science. I am currently working with Dr. Ruoti in the USER Lab, and my focus is on usable security. Specifically, I am working on ways to make password managers better for devices that do not support auto-fill. I enjoy coding and usable security, and I would like to use this course as an opportunity to learn more techniques I can leverage to build better software development tools.
