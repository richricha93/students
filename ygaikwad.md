Hey there! I'm Yashraj, first year masters student studying Computer Science. My personal interest is in game developement but I've made projects in the domain of web development and machine learning. 
Through this course I want to gain knowledge about the techniques used to improvise the software developement process which I can effectively apply to my own projects.
