I am Bryson Gullett and I am a first year computer science masters student. I work under
Dr. Plank as a graduate research assistant in the TENNLab neuromorphic computing group
here at UTK. My research focuses on deploying spiking neural networks in embedded
systems. Though I have some hardware background with an undergraduate degree in computer
engineering, I have more experience in computer programming. I particularly enjoy
solving real-world problems with a combination of software and hardware. I hope to hone
my software development skills in this course.
