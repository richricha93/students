Hi, my name is Arshita, a masterâ€™s student specializing in software processes and technologies. I am keenly interested in the practical aspects of software design, maintenance, and testing. In this class I aim to deepen my knowledge in managing large software projects and explore the latest methodologies in software engineering.
