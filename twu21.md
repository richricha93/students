Hi, I am Tianhao Wu, a second-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science under the supervision of Dr. Jian Liu. My research interests are Mobile sensing, LLMs (Large Language Models), and AI for smart fitness and health monitoring. 
I want to learn some software engineering which is important in building mobile sensing systems.
