I am Abram Bradley. I am a course-only graduate student. I TA CS1202 for Professor Camille Crumpton.
I have experience doing research for Dr. Penumadu and Dr. Williams developing React applications.
I am looking forward to learn more about software engineering.
I am planning to be a software engineer after I graduate.
