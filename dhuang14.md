I am David Huang and I am a Computer Science masters student on the Thesis track. My current interests and research are in cyber security, specifically creating novel password generation algorithms and user interfances that are user-centered. I am taking this course to develop my understanding of software engineering and project timeline management with the hopes of learning new tools or processes.
