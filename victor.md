Hi, this is Victor Hazlewood.  Note the correct spelling of my last name with the "L" before "E".   I am a thesis Master's student with advisor Dr. Greg Peterson. I am also a full time employee of University of Tennessee, Knoxville and
am the Associate CIO & Director of High Performance & Scientific Computing in the Office of Innovative Technology for the University.   I lead high performance computing for the University and also the OIT HPSC group has recently
purchased an archival storage system, called the UT Storage resource for Research (UT-StorR), for the University.  There are likely several projects ideas related to either HPC or UT-StorR that I could work on for this class.
